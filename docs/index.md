# Diy Arduino Gimbal

A 3D printed do-it-yourself (DIY) gimbal - fitted with 3 FS90 Micro servo motors - is controlled using an MPU6050 inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor in order to keep the 3D printed platform stable during rotation in any axis. The servo motors and the IMU sensor are connected to the Arduino Nano microcontroller.

## Hardware

### Components

The following components (and tools) were used in this project:

- 3D printed gimbal parts

- Arduino Nano (and usb cable)

- MPU6050

- 3 x FS90 Micro servo motors

- LM2596 Buck Regulator

- 9V battery

- 2.54 mm female and male headers

- Loose cables to solder on female/male headers

- Veroboard to solder on female headers (for the arduino nano and MPU6050) and
male headers for the servo cables

- On/Off switch

- Soldering iron

- Screwdriver set

- Double sided tape

- Duck tape

### Project Wiring

The diagram below shows how the electronic components of the gimbal are connected.
